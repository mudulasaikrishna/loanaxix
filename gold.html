            <h2>GOLD LOAN</h2>
            <p>
                A gold loan is a type of secured loan given in exchange for gold jewelry or coins to provide instant financial assistance. It is a great option for people with insufficient collateral to get a bank loan.
                The borrower, who is typically willing to exchange cash for gold, receives the loan in exchange for providing some sort of collateral and agrees to repay it with interest over a specific period. The biggest disadvantage of taking a gold loan is that you stand to lose your collateral in case of default. However, to mitigate this risk, some lenders offer insurance packages for your gold items that protect them in case of accident or theft.
