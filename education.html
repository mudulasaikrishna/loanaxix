            <h2>EDUCATIONAL LOAN</h2>
            <p>
                An education loan is a form of financial assistance that provides the student with funds to pursue higher education. The funds raised on the student loan for study abroad can finance tuition, exam, library, and activity fee, including other facilities such as accommodation/dorm, courses, equipment, etc.
                It is paid back in EMIs(Equated Monthly Installments) with interest once the student starts earning i.e by definition between 6 to 12 months after the student who has obtained the student loan for study abroad has graduated, known as the moratorium period. There are various education loan types available for students, and these loans vary from bank to bank. However, on average, the loan acquired is usually between Rs.1 lakh and Rs.5 lakh, extended as required. The interest rates on loans are currently between 8% to 10%.
