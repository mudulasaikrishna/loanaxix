            <div><h1>Types</h1></div>
            <p><strong>Term Loan:</strong> Short-term or long-term loans ranging from anywhere between 1 – 5 years can be obtained with term loans paid over a specified period of time with loan amounts extending up to 1 crore at zero collateral funding options.</p>
            <p><strong>Machinery Loan:</strong> Machinery or equipment loans facilitate the purchase of high-end or high-cost machinery required for the business to operate smoothly with or without collateral varying from lender to lender.</p>
            <p><strong>Start-Up Loan:</strong> If you are an entrepreneur, you will need to cover the expenditure of starting a new venture and take up the burden of investing in capital growth. With a start-up loan, the lender might provide added benefits if the borrower has a clean record of their credit and submits the business proof documents of its establishment and existence in the market.</p>
            <p><strong>Invoice Financing:</strong> Invoice discounting or invoice factoring is when the business fails to close the gap between the raised invoices and payments from the clients in time. Thus the business receives a loan amount of up to 90% of the invoice from the lender to pay off the debts agreed upon in the contract.</p>
            <p><strong>Business Overdraft:</strong> Offered against collateral or security, an overdraft facility helps the borrower to draw funds from their account even when the balance is zero subjected to his/her cash inflow/outflow, relationship with the lender, credit history, etc, especially with a fixed deposit existing in the bank.</p>
            <p<strong>Working Capital Loan:</strong>Working Capital Loan: Also known as collateral-free loans, these loans help the business owners to pay off their debts, run their equipment, and meet several other daily requirements of the business in the short term.</p>
            <p><strong>Point-Of-Sale (POS) Loan:</strong> POS or merchant cash advance is a loan based on your future sales. This means that it is important to make sure your business has enough cash flow to repay the loan. A business that is doing well can repay the loan more quickly.</p>
            <p><strong>Business Credit Card:</strong> It is a short-term loan that you can use for several purposes in case of emergencies with a variety of added benefits such as cashback, insurance covers, etc but with much higher interest rates compared to the other types of loans. Given the circumstances and nature of the loan, this is considered to be the last straw or last resort for business owners in emergencies.</p>
            <p><strong>LAP (Loan Against Property):</strong> A collateral or security loan can be obtained easily without any stress or burden on the borrower and the lender when the investor decides to provide security against the loan amount borrowed from the lender. This will not only improve the relationship with the lender but it gives an added advantage to the benefits in the market now that the lender knows that they can trust you with the repayment capabilities.</p>
