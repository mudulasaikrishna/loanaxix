                <h2>PERSONAL LOAN</h2>
                <p>A personal loan is an unsecured credit loan that does not require any collateral or security. This type of loan gives you the opportunity to borrow money without putting any of your assets at risk. The amount borrowed on personal loans can be used for a variety of purposes like consolidating debts, clearing unforeseen expenses, organizing a marriage, paying for a vacation, settling medical emergencies, etc.
                   Personal loans typically have lower bank loan interest rates than credit cards, making them an attractive option for those who are looking to save money on interest payments. The sum acquired is repaid over time with interest and is sanctioned based on the repayment capabilities and creditworthiness of the applicant. It is a relatively quick and high funding process if met with the necessary prerequisites of the lender.
